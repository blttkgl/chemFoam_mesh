![OpenFOAM 8](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenFOAM-8-brightgreen)

A variation of OpenFOAM's chemFoam solver that runs on a full mesh instead of a single cell mesh.

## Why do I need this?

* If you want to freeze the flow in your reactive simulation and run 0D reactors on your cell data. Two published work using such analysis are  [[1]](#1) and  [[2]](#2)

* If you have any sort of application where you transfer your (Y,p,T) data from your OpenFOAM simulation to a chemistry solver such as Cantera or CHEMKIN, this lets you do it in OpenFOAM instead.

* By configuring the simulation case you can even do parameter sweeps in OpenFOAM. Example: Keep concentrations constant, vary the temperature in domain and use this solver for a temperature sweep on a certain mixture.
