# chemFoam_mesh
![OpenFOAM 8](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenFOAM-8-brightgreen)

A variation of OpenFOAM's chemFoam solver that runs on a full mesh instead of a single cell mesh.

## Why do I need this?

* If you want to freeze the flow in your reactive simulation and run 0D reactors on your cell data. Two published work using such approach are  [[1]](#1) and  [[2]](#2)
